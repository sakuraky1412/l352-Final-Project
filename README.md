# l352-Final-Project
Reimplementation of physically based lens flare and deep lens

This project is largely credited to the paper [Physically-Based Real-Time Lens Flare Rendering](http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/lensflareRendering/pdf/flare.pdf), the codebase [PhysicallyBasedLensFlare](https://github.com/greje656/PhysicallyBasedLensFlare/tree/master/Lens), and [DeepLens: Shallow Depth-of-Field from a Single Image](https://github.com/scott89/deeplens_eval), since it reimplements the lens flare and depth-of-field camera effects of corresponding papers.
